Hey there! Welcome to my profile. I am Amdjad, a passionate IT student from France. I love software development and data analysis, and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn.

In addition to my studies, I'm also pursuing my passion for **space news** and **physics** through self-learning.

I'm currently focusing on improving my skills in JS, SHELL, and REST API. If you're interested in collaborating on a project or just want to connect, feel free to reach out to me via email ^^.

Above you'll find a list of my coding skills. Thanks for stopping by!
